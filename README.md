# HealthCare-Data-Analysis-with-SQL
🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis (SQL Project)
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates healthcare data analysis using SQL. The dataset is designed to replicate a real-world hospital management system, covering patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and prescriptions.
It provides opportunities to explore data analysis, reporting, and insights generation within the healthcare domain, making it a valuable resource for students, data analysts, and SQL learners.

🗂️ Dataset

The repository includes a CSV file (health_db.csv) that contains multiple tables combined for database creation and query execution.
Tables Included
Patients – Patient demographics such as name, gender, and date of birth.
Doctors – Doctor details including specialties.
Appointments – Records of patient visits, reasons, and assigned doctors.
Billing – Payment details like amount, payment date, and status.
Prescriptions – Medications prescribed, dosage, and instructions.

🎯 Objectives

This project allows you to:
Track appointments and link patients with doctors.
Analyze billing performance (total billed, paid vs. pending).
Review doctor workload and specialties with the highest appointments.
Identify patient activity trends (latest visits, no appointments, frequent visitors).
Study prescriptions data for medication patterns and dosage summaries.
Generate time-based insights (monthly billing, recent appointments, trends).

🚀 Getting Started

Import the Dataset
Load the provided CSV file (health_db.csv) into your SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
Create Database Schema
Define tables for patients, doctors, appointments, billing, and prescriptions.
Run SQL Queries
Execute analysis queries to generate reports and insights about patient care, billing, and healthcare operations.

📊 Example Insights

Some of the insights that can be derived from this project include:
Top patients by total billed amount.
Doctors with the highest number of appointments.
Most common appointment reasons.
Monthly paid vs. pending billing trends.
Patients with no appointments or unpaid bills.
Most frequently prescribed medications.

🤝 Contributions
Contributions are welcome! You can:
Add new analytical queries and scenarios.
Enhance the dataset with more healthcare entities (e.g., nurses, departments).
Improve documentation for learning purposes.
